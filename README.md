This project was challenging, though enjoyable to complete, and the end result is so worth it!
I completed the mandatory and 4/5 of the bonus (everything except the third fractal). Note: The zoom centering the cursor is not perfect - please share if you figure it out!


The versions included are /linux /macos_commented and /norminette


Here is the outline of how I tackled fract-ol:


Step 1: Learn the MiniLibX graphical library
Step 2: Learn the Complex numbers notion


Step 3: Learn how Fractals work


Step 4: Learn about Event handling in the context of the project


Step 5: Plan the structure of directories and files


Step 6: Implement fract-ol


Step 7: Test fract-ol against the evaluation checklist
I worked with Linux, and once the program functioned, I translated the code to work on MacOS. See notes here: Differences between Linux and MacOS (though it might not make sense before delving in to the project's implementation).
